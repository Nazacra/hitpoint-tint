# Hitpoint-Tint

A basic FoundryVTT module for tinting tokens based on their current HP.

## Requirements / Limitations:
- https://github.com/ardittristan/VTTColorSettings is used for settings / color picking.
- Currently only the 5e module for FoundryVTT is tested / supported.
- Token tints will only be updated on the current active scene
- Token tints will only be updated if the current HP changes (i.e. increase in Max HP will not be reflected)
